/*
 * Why should you use abstract and final in class definition?
 * 
 * - to allow instantiation
 * - to allow inheritance
 * - to better communicate intentions (correct)
 * - to define methods


 * Why would you create an abstract class, if it can have no real instances?
 * - to avoid redundant coding in child classes (correct) -> inheritance 
 * - to prevent unwanted method implementation            -> interfaces
 * - to reserve memory for an unspecified class type
 * - to explore a hypothetical class
 * 

 * Which option correctly describes abstraction?
 * - revealing the implementation and the relevant parts of the application
 * - hinding the important data
 * - revealing only the relevant parts of application while keeping the inner implementation hidden (correct)
 * - hiding the important features of the apllication
 *
